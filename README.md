  ## Description

  
   I wanted to get a better understanding and practice with working with non relational database and in this case with MongoDb/mongoose. This helps storing and processing large amounts of unstructured data making creation of it and the maintenance of it much more faster and simpler than you would with a relational database. The use of a non relational database is definitely much more faster but can be harder to keep track of data so I would say using a non relational database isn't the answer all the time.

  ## Installation
  

  1) had to create and clone a repo into my local. 2) Then I created all file structures needed for controllers, routes, models, server. etc. 3) in terminal directory where repo was at I ran "npm init -y" to get ready to install necessary npm packages and create package-json. 4) Next I ran command "npm i express mongoose nodemon" as the packages I would be using. 5) lastly I added to script tag in package.json "nodemon index.js" and ran that also in my terminal to activate my server, which was successful and working.
  



  ## Usage
  

  1) need to run npm i to install all npm packages and create package.json and package-lock.json. 2) in terminal or bash you need to run command "npm run start" to start server. 3) Once running on local server you can use preferred API REST Client and test out routes and see they are functioning.
